repair	is a	medical procedure
repair	used for	traumatic injury
repair	used for	cranial nerves
repair	used for	peripheral nerves
traumatic injury	can cause	nerve damage
nerve damage	can lead to	chronic pain
nerve damage	can result in	loss of sensation
nerve damage	can cause	muscle weakness
nerve damage	can lead to	functional impairment
nerve damage	can result in	mobility issues
chronic pain	can affect	quality of life
loss of sensation	can lead to	accidental injuries
muscle weakness	can cause	difficulty in movement
functional impairment	can affect	daily activities
mobility issues	can result in	dependency
mobility issues	can lead to	falls
accidental injuries	can result in	infections
difficulty in movement	can cause	joint problems
infections	can lead to	complications
joint problems	can result in	arthritis
complications	can affect	recovery process
arthritis	can cause	chronic pain
recovery process	can take	a long time
recovery process	can require	physical therapy
chronic pain	can require	pain management
physical therapy	can help	regain function
pain management	can improve	quality of life
pain management	can involve	medication
pain management	can include	alternative treatments
medication	can have	side effects
